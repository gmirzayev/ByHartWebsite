        Every strip starts with a sketch. A gag. A storyboard. An inkling of an idea, brought to life by a pencil, some
        paper (okay, occasionally a tablet and stylus), and an altogether personal point of view. It's the first step in
        a hero’s winding journey—both the character’s and the creator’s—soon to meet the fans who will cheer them along.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comics Kingdom is for those who believe in limitless creativity, barely contained in a bite of delight. The ones
        who must make, against any obstacles, whether pioneers or next generation, in service of an art form that nudges
        us all forward, eliciting chuckles, catharsis, and connection.

        We're a haven for those who absolutely worship cartoon history and are eager to preserve and transform. A
        community for the people who open to the funnies every week or get the digital scoop any day. A place for
        enthusiasts to support others and recognize the wonderfully human lessons and observations depicted through a
        beloved and all too rare craft. A platform for artists to breathe new life, share new experiences, and reach new
        friends. A way to come together through a niche that unifies—one of the lightest ways to deal with heavy stuff.

        For <em>those</em>, for <em>us</em>, and for <em>all</em>, our mission is to keep the comics coming.

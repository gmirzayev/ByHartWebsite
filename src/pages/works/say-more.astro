        <p>Say More is an original collection of conversation cards and journaling prompts conceived of, written, and lovingly designed by Sarah's Hartley's story + design studio, By Hart, for Kindra in partnership with Omisade Burney-Scott (Black Girlâ€™s Guide to Surviving Menopause). We created Say More together to empower us all to honor our intersecting and shape-shifting identities, learn from intergenerational wisdom, revitalize our perspectives on aging, and practice compassionate self-care in times of transformation.</p>
